### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Question: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**
Hypothesis: the % of people who did diets for ___ period of time lost more weight than people who did exercise
Null Hypothesis: the % of people who did diets for ___ period of time have lost the same or less weight than people who did exercise
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

**Question: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Hypothesis: The mean IQ of children (at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 year) of smokers is same as of non-smokers
Null Hypothesis: The mean IQ of children (at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 year) of smokers is lower or higher than of non-smokers
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

**Question: Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Hypothesis: 
Null Hypothesis:
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, 
and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. 
This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
