# HW7

# Assignment 1
We worked together with Ana (as9788) on the Citi Bike data investigation. In the HW3 we have formulated the idea, derived a hypothesis and performed data wrangiling to check whether proportions are significantly different.
### IDEA:
Customers are less likely than Subscribers to choose biking _for commuting_

Our HW3 proposal was reviewed by Kent (kwp225). Since we are working with categorical variables and testing proportions, all have agreed that the Chi-Square test of proportions will be the best option.

Upon completion of a statistical test, we have written an Authorea report to present our findings. It can be found here:
