# Assignment 1
We teamed up with Ana (as9788) to work on the hypothesis formulation.
### IDEA:
There are more trips in Summer rather then in Winter time

### NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The mean number of weekly bike trips made by citibike users during July 2016 is the same or higher than the corresponding number of weekly bike trips made by citibike users during January 2016.

### ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
The mean number of weekly bike trips made by citibike users during July 2016 is significantly lower than the corresponding number of weekly bike trips made by citibike users during January 2016.

Significance level: 0.05
