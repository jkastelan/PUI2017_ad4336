# Assignment 1
We teamed up with Ana (as9788) to work on the hypothesis formulation.
### IDEA:
Customers are less likely than Subscribers to choose biking _for commuting_

### NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The ratio of subscribers biking on weekends over subscribers biking on weekdays is _the same_ or _higher_ than the ratio of customers biking on weekends over customers biking on weekdays.
### ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
The ratio of subscribers biking on weekends over subscribers biking on weekdays is _less_ than the ratio of customers biking on weekends over customers biking on weekdays.

# _$H_0$_ : $\frac{S{\mathrm{weekend}}}{S{\mathrm{weekdays}}} => \frac{C{\mathrm{weekend}}}{C{\mathrm{weekdays}}}$
# _$H_1$_ : $\frac{S{\mathrm{weekend}}}{S{\mathrm{weekdays}}} < \frac{C{\mathrm{weekend}}}{C{\mathrm{weekdays}}}$

<=>

# _$H_0$_ : $\frac{S{\mathrm{weekend}}}{S{\mathrm{weekdays}}} - \frac{C{\mathrm{weekend}}}{C{\mathrm{weekdays}}} => 0 $
# _$H_1$_ : $\frac{S{\mathrm{weekend}}}{S{\mathrm{weekdays}}} - \frac{C{\mathrm{weekend}}}{C{\mathrm{weekdays}}} < 0 $


Significance level:  $\alpha=0.05$

# Assignment 2
I was working by myself based on the https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW7_fb55/SQL_query.ipynb sceleton.
